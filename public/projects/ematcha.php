                    <p class="col col-10">To simulate a real-life client scenario, we randomly received a fellow student's idea for a company. They would serve as our on-going client where we could receive feedback and suggestions. I received the following guidelines:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Company Name: Emerald Matcha</li>
                        <li>Product: Matcha Powder</li>
                        <li>Main Colour: #00A651</li>
                        <li>Customer Demographic: 25-45 year olds</li>
                        <li>Competitors: Jade Leaf Matcha, Grace & Green Matcha</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>Logo Design</h2>
                    <p>For the logo design, I wanted to draw inspiration from the company name by incorporating a matcha leaf and the shape of a gemstone. I also wanted to create a simple and clean logo to appeal to the younger customer demographic. After consulting with my client, I decided the final logo would be a matcha leaf in-laid in a tear-drop shaped gem.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Colour Palette</h2>
                    <p>To go with the deep green colour given by the client, I decided to go with a Split Complementary colour scheme of green, pink and yellow. This colour scheme gives a retro trendy vibe, which encapsulates the idea of targeting a younger audience with a traditional matcha product. Pink and yellow would serve as visually-striking colours in comparison with the primary green colour.</p>
